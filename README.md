# Neuroscience.github.io
This Page was created while I took my Basic Neuroscience class. The goal here is to present the course in the most simplistic form possible based on 
what was helpful and worked for me so others can also benefit from my "summary" or tutorial. I in addition added links to sites and other resources I found 
very useful during my study. 

This tutorial/short course is divided into 4 parts and is structured with their various subparts as follow.

- Introduction to Sensory Systems
- Introduction to Motor Systems
- Introduction to Regulatory Systems
- Introduction to Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience

I hope you enjoy you study and I wish you the very best in your academic pursuits.
